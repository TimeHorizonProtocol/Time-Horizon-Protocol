# Time Horizon Protocol (THP)

**A Proactive Stability Engine for Global Financial Markets**

The Time Horizon Protocol is an open-source proof-of-concept for an intelligent Circuit Breaker 2.0.

Instead of abruptly halting trading, it gently slows down the market to dampen panic waves:
- Preemptive Soft Throttling
- Targeted Latency Injection
- Asset-Specific Cooling-Off Periods
- Global Speed Limit with FIFO queuing

It integrates real-time oracles (social sentiment from X, geopolitical risk, orderbook imbalance) and full epistemic transparency via the Glass Floor Layer.

**Goal:** Make financial markets more resilient without destroying liquidity.
